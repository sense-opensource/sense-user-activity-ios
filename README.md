<p> Sense is a client side library that enables you to identify users by pinpointing their hardware and software characteristics. This is done by computing a token that stays consistent in spite of any manipulation.</p>                           
<p> This tracking method works even in the browser's incognito mode and is not cleared by flushing the cache, closing the browser or restarting the operating system, using a VPN or installing AdBlockers. Sense is available as SenseOS for every open source requirement and is different from Sense PRO, our extremely accurate and detailed product.</p>


<p> Sense’s real time demo : https://pro.getsense.co/

**Try visiting the same page in an incognito mode or switch on the VPN and 
notice how the visitor identifier remains the same in spite of all these changes!**
