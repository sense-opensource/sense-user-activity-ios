<p> Sense is a client side library that enables you to identify users by pinpointing their hardware and software characteristics. This is done by computing a token that stays consistent in spite of any manipulation.</p>                           
<p> This tracking method works even in the browser's incognito mode and is not cleared by flushing the cache, closing the browser or restarting the operating system, using a VPN or installing AdBlockers. Sense is available as SenseOS for every open source requirement and is different from Sense PRO, our extremely accurate and detailed product.</p>


<p> Sense’s real time demo : https://pro.getsense.co/

**Try visiting the same page in an incognito mode or switch on the VPN and 
notice how the visitor identifier remains the same in spite of all these changes!** 

<h3>Getting started with Sense </h3>

```
<h3>Sense - iOS SDK</h3>

Sense is a device intelligence and identification tool. This tool collects a comprehensive set of attributes unique to a device or browser, forming an identity that will help businesses.
Requirements


<h3>Requirements</h3>

* OS 12.0 or above
* Swift version 5.0 and above

Note: If the application does not have the listed permissions, the values collected using those permissions will be ignored. To provide a valid device details, we recommend employing as much permission as possible based on your use-case.

Note: In your controller, there are at least two text fields and a scrollview.

Step 1 - Import SDK

```
  import SenseOSUserActivity
````
Step 2 - Add Delegate Method

Add the delegate method in your Controller Class file
````
SenseOSUserActivityDelegate
````

Step 3 - Detect User Activity

Use the lines below to invoke ViewDidLoad.

```
SenseOSUserActivity.initKeyStrokeBehaviour(for: [txtUsername, txtPassword]);
SenseOSUserActivity.initScrollBehaviour(for: [scrollView]);
SenseOSUserActivity.initTouchBehaviour(for: self.view)
```

Step 4 - Get Device Details

Use the line below to invoke any button action or ViewDidLoad to get the DeviceDetails.

```
 SenseOSUserActivity.getSenseDetails(withDelegate: self)

```

Step 5 - Implement Delegate Method

Set and Implement our Delegate method to receive the Callback details

```
 extension ViewController: SenseOSUserActivityDelegate{
    func onFailure(message: String) {
        // Failure Callback.
    }
    func onSuccess(data: [String : Any]) {
        // Success Callback
    }
}

```

Sample Program

Here you can find the demonstration to do the integration.

```
import UIKit
import SenseOSUserActivity

class SenseOSController: UIViewController, SenseOSUserActivityDelegate {

  override func viewDidLoad() {
      super.viewDidLoad()
	SenseOSUserActivity.initKeyStrokeBehaviour(for: [txtUsername, txtPassword]);
	SenseOSUserActivity.initScrollBehaviour(for: [scrollView]);
	SenseOSUserActivity.initTouchBehaviour(for: self.view)
      
  }

 @IBAction func btnSense(_ sender: Any) {
     
      SenseOSUserActivity.getSenseDetails(withDelegate: self)
  }

  @objc func onSuccess(data: String) {     
      // Handle success callback
  }
  @objc func onFailure(message: String) {
      // Handle failure callback
  }
}
  
```
